# Digital-Music-Store-Analysis
# Description
The music industry thrives on data-driven decision-making. In this project, I worked with a digital music store dataset that includes customer preferences, sales records, and user ratings. Using SQL, I analyzed customer preferences, track sales trends for different genres or artists, and provide recommendations for optimizing the music catalog. This project allowed me to showcase analytical skills in the context of the music industry and contribute to data-driven decision-making. Through the application of SQL queries, this project aims to unravel valuable insights and answer numerous critical questions about our music store's operations. By diving deep into the dataset, we aspire to gain profound understanding and enhance decision-making processes within the realm of our music retail venture. Join us in this data-driven exploration!
